************** FREECODECAMP NODEJS AND EXPRESSJS ******************

Mind Grenade in Node is simply to call a different js file with require('./fileName')


Built In Modules in NodeJS

->OS
->PATH
-> FS
-> HTTP


-> FS

Like in Python, we open the file and read and write in it
We can also do that in NodeJS

using const {'readFileSync','writeFileSync'} = require('fs')

flag : 'a' => To append


Using readsync to read and write files in JS will give a line by line description of the code. Meaning Synchronise way to read and write the file


1:35:00 -> HTTP Module

again, we'll be creating the HTTP Module using require('http')

const http = require('http')
const server = http.server((req, res)=>{
///2F

})


NPM is a Node Package Manager used to install any type of publically available library out on the web
